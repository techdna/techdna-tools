    in other words deleted files in <pathToMeasure> are ignored.

 Scan All, ignoring config files:

    Normal Surveyor measurement is dictated by config files -- only file

    Scanning is useful to ensure that all file types you want to consider
    are included when tuning config files.

    -a      Attempt to measure all files in folder tree. Files that start with
            binary characters will not have per-line measurements produced.

    -an     Quick scan using the NBNC module to measure likely code files.
            To determine likely code files, a number of filters are used:
                + Folders and files starting with "." and "cvs" are skipped
                + Common non-code file extensions are skipped (-sn)
                + Files detected as binary are skipped (-sb)

            criteria as "-an", but uses the Code module to do a full analysis
            of the file, including detecting generated machine code.

 Exclude duplicate file measures:

    Zeros out measure and analysis information for duplicate files.

    NOTE ABOUT DUPLICATE PROCESSING
    Since duplicates are checked and processed by Surveyor as results are received, 
    and since Surveyor jobs are likely using multiple cores to process groups of 
    files, it is possible that different runs against the same folder tree will
    produce slightly different dupe results -- not in the totals, but in which
    dupe file instance gets credit for being "first". This can change the roll-ups
    of folder trees the duplicate each other's files. 

    -excludeDupes [byteThreshold]

    Will keep track of file names and sizes (in bytes). If files with the same
    name are encountered whose size is within [byteThreshold] of a previously
    measured file, metadata for the file will be written in output, but no
    measures will be recorded.

    This allows both detection of duplicates or near-dupes, as well as
    aggregate measures that do not include the duplicate files.
    [byteThreshold] defaults to 0, or an exact match in size

    -excludeDupes crc

    Uses the Code csmodule's per-file CRC calculation to detect duplicates. This
    works similarly to above, except file name is ignored and only the nbnc.crc
    measure is compared.
    This CRC is NOT a simple file CRC -- nbnc.crc is calculated based on considering
    only the non-whitespace content of NBNC lines of human-written code. This updates
    in comments or minor whitespace changes will not change the CRC and thus be
    considered duplicates.
